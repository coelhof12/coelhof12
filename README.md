## About Me 🧑‍💻

I'm a Junior Full-Stack Developer transitioning from a background in design to building scalable and efficient web applications. I specialize in Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, and I’m always excited to explore new technologies.

Based in Aveiro, Portugal, I am looking to make a positive impact through creative and sustainable tech solutions. Let's connect and build something amazing together!

## What Drives Me 🚀

What excites me most about full stack development is the ability to build comprehensive solutions that span both the front-end and back-end. I thrive on creating applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing. Every project is an opportunity to solve problems, learn new technologies, and push the boundaries of what's possible.

## My Journey 🛤️

From a young age, I was fascinated by the potential of technology to transform ideas into reality. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Design from the University of Aveiro. During my studies, I was actively involved in various student organizations, holding positions such as Vice-President of the Academic Association and Member of the Pedagogical Council. These experiences honed my leadership and teamwork skills, preparing me for the collaborative nature of the tech industry.

## Skills & Learning Goals 📚
