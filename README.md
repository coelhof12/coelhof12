## The Concept

## About Me 🧑‍💻

Hello! I'm Francisco Coelho, a passionate Full Stack Developer with experience in Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I enjoy creating efficient and scalable web applications. Based in Aveiro, Portugal.

I am redirecting my career towards programming after studying and applying design knowledge.
I aim to explore emerging technologies and develop creative and sustainable solutions that can make a positive impact.

## What Drives Me 🚀

What excites me most about full stack development is the ability to build comprehensive solutions that span both the front-end and back-end. I thrive on creating applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing. Every project is an opportunity to solve problems, learn new technologies, and push the boundaries of what's possible.

## Beyond Code 🌟

Outside of work, I enjoy sports, listening and playing music, exploring diferent cultures by traveling, gaming, which help me stay balanced and inspired. Whether it's playing music, gaming, or exploring new technologies, I believe in the importance of continuous learning and personal growth.

## My Journey 🛤️

From a young age, I was fascinated by the potential of technology to transform ideas into reality. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Design from the University of Aveiro. During my studies, I was actively involved in various student organizations, holding positions such as Vice-President of the Academic Association and Member of the Pedagogical Council. These experiences honed my leadership and teamwork skills, preparing me for the collaborative nature of the tech industry.
