## What Drives Me 🚀

What excites me most about full stack development is the ability to build comprehensive solutions that span both the front-end and back-end. I thrive on creating applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing. Every project is an opportunity to solve problems, learn new technologies, and push the boundaries of what's possible.

During my studies, I was actively involved in various student organizations, holding positions such as Vice-President of the Academic Association and Member of the Pedagogical Council. These experiences honed my leadership and teamwork skills, preparing me for the collaborative nature of the tech industry.
