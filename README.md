## About Me 🧑‍💻

Hello! I'm Francisco Coelho, a passionate Full Stack Developer with experience in Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I enjoy creating efficient and scalable web applications. Based in Aveiro, Portugal.

My professional journey began with roles that allowed me to explore different facets of design and development. As a Design Director at Cértoma, I contributed to innovative design solutions in a unique industry. Simultaneously, I co-founded NBox, Lda, where we specialize in the commercialization of wooden boxes and other articles. These roles have enriched my understanding of both the creative and business aspects of product development.

## What Drives Me 🚀

What excites me most about full stack development is the ability to build comprehensive solutions that span both the front-end and back-end. I thrive on creating applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing. Every project is an opportunity to solve problems, learn new technologies, and push the boundaries of what's possible.

## Beyond Code 🌟

Outside of work, I enjoy sports, music, and gaming, which help me stay balanced and inspired. Whether it's playing music, gaming, or exploring new technologies, I believe in the importance of continuous learning and personal growth.

## My Journey 🛤️

From a young age, I was fascinated by the potential of technology to transform ideas into reality. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Design from the University of Aveiro. During my studies, I was actively involved in various student organizations, holding positions such as Vice-President of the Academic Association and Member of the Pedagogical Council. These experiences honed my leadership and teamwork skills, preparing me for the collaborative nature of the tech industry.
